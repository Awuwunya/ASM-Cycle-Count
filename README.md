# ASM Cycle Count
This is a long term project for me to create cycle counter for Motorola 68000 instructions. It was created to make it easier to calculate how long a subroutine or individual instruction would run. This could help in optimizing existing code, or creating new code, that had to run in exact number of cycles for example. The tool uses the text you paste for determining instructions used. It is important to note, that the interpreter itself is "dumb", and may not be able to determine correct addressing modes in nonstandard syntax. While I wanted to avoid end users having to edit the code in significant way, you may need to modify or remove some elements to make your code unambigious, and be compatible. The tool uses asm68k syntax as a base for the conversion. Also important to note, the tool will enforce the convention where code must not be at the start of a line, or it will be treated as a label. I provide this tool "as is", because I never planned a formal release of this. This means, any bugs, issues, crashes, etc may not be fixed at any time for any reason, but if you find issues, it is worth posting an issue nevertheless.
